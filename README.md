# Data Science Project Brexit and NHS

NHS is the backbone of English society as it is the only healthcare provider in the country. However, as there are disparities within societies, there are disparities within the NHS itself as poorer and sicker communities are getting less money to operate. As Brexit was indeed a mirror of societal inequalities, the aim of this data-inform essay investigated the effect of NHS payments to local GPs on voting decision-making. The results were surprising as there was a modest association between NHS spending and an area’s voting behaviour and the “left-behind” hypothesis was indeed confirmed.
