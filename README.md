# Data Science Project Brexit and NHS

NHS is the backbone of English society as it is the only healthcare provider in the country. That is the reason why social inequalities are reflected in it. On the other hand, Brexit voting is considered an echo of social disparities. Thus, this paper tries to identify the causal relationship between NHS spending at a GP level and the EU Referendum voting propensity. The results were surprising as there was an association between the two factors that could be used by the public and health policymakers.
